Problem:
```
Kevin Kangaroo begins hopping on a number line at 0. He wants to get to 1, but he can hop only $\frac{1}{3}$ of the distance. Each hop tires him out so that he continues to hop $\frac{1}{3}$ of the remaining distance. How far has he hopped after five hops? Express your answer as a common fraction.
```
Answer:
```
Let's think step by step
Kevin hops $1/3$ of the remaining distance with every hop.
His first hop takes $1/3$ closer.
For his second hop, he has $2/3$ left to travel, so he hops forward $(2/3)(1/3)$.
For his third hop, he has $(2/3)^2$ left to travel, so he hops forward $(2/3)^2(1/3)$.
In general, Kevin hops forward $(2/3)^{k-1}(1/3)$ on his $k$th hop.
We want to find how far he has hopped after five hops.
This is a finite geometric series with first term $1/3$, common ratio $2/3$, and five terms.
Thus, Kevin has hopped $\frac{\frac{1}{3}\left(1-\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^5\right)}{1-\frac{2}{3}} = \boxed{\frac{211}{243}}$.
The answer is \frac{211}{243}}

Problem:
```
What is the area of the region defined by the equation $x^2+y^2 - 7 = 4y-14x+3$?
```
Answer:
```
Let's think step by step
We rewrite the equation as $x^2 + 14x + y^2 - 4y = 10$ and then complete the square,
resulting in  $(x+7)^2-49 + (y-2)^2-4=10$,
or $(x+7)^2+(y-2)^2=63$.
This is the equation of a circle with center $(-7, 2)$ and radius $\sqrt{63},$
so the area of this region is $\pi r^2 = \boxed{63\pi}$.
The answer is 63\pi
```

[example 3]
Problem:
```
If $x^2+y^2=1$, what is the largest possible value of $|x|+|y|$?
```
Answer:
```
Let's think step by step
If $(x,y)$ lies on the circle,
so does $(x,-y),$ $(-x,-y),$ and $(-x,-y),$ (which all give the same value of $|x| + |y|$),
so we can assume that $x \ge 0$ and $y \ge 0.$
Then $|x| + |y| = x + y.$  Squaring, we get
\[(x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 1 + 2xy.\]
Note that $(x - y)^2 \ge 0.$
Expanding, we get $x^2 - 2xy + y^2 \ge 0,$ so $2xy \le x^2 + y^2 = 1.$
Hence,\[1 + 2xy \le 2,\]which means $x + y \le \sqrt{2}.$
Equality occurs when $x = y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},$
so the maximum value of $|x| + |y|$ is $\boxed{\sqrt{2}}.$
The answer is \sqrt{2}
